<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Looking from the hall door towards the road, the forest in which our castle stands extends fifteen miles to the right, and twelve to the left. The nearest inhabited village is about seven of your English miles to the left. The nearest inhabited schloss of any historic associations, is that of old General Spielsdorf, nearly twenty miles away to the right.</p><p>I have said "the nearest <em>inhabited</em> village," because there is, only three miles westward, that is to say in the direction of General Spielsdorf's schloss, a ruined village, with its quaint little church, now roofless, in the aisle of which are the moldering tombs of the proud family of Karnstein, now extinct, who once owned the equally desolate chateau which, in the thick of the forest, overlooks the silent ruins of the town.</p><p>Respecting the cause of the desertion of this striking and melancholy spot, there is a legend which I shall relate to you another time.</p></div> </div>
